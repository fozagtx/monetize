**So simple even your grandma can accept crypto payments ðŸ˜Œ**

## What It Does for Creators

Monetize gives you powerful tools to turn your content and community into revenue:

- **Digital Product Sales:** Upload and sell any digital product with one-time USDC payments
- **Discord Community Access:** Sell access to exclusive Discord channels with recurring subscriptions
- **Automatic Access Control:** Members get kicked when payments fail - no manual management needed
- **Base Blockchain Payments:** Accept USDC on Base with minimal gas fees and instant settlements

## Real-World Usage Examples

### **Selling a Digital Course**

> I have a video course on web development. I upload the course details, set my Base wallet address, price it at $49 USDC, and share the payment link. Buyers pay with crypto and instantly get access to the course URL.

---

### **Monetizing a Discord Community**

> I run a trading signals Discord server. I connect my Discord account, select my private channels, set a $29/month recurring subscription, and add the Monetize bot. Members pay monthly in USDC, and if they miss 3 payments, they're automatically removed from the channels.

---

### **Creating a Premium Newsletter**

> I write a weekly newsletter with exclusive content. I create a product listing with my Substack URL, set the price at $10 USDC, and share the payment link with my audience. Subscribers pay once and get permanent access.
